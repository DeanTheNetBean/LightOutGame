#Lights Out Game
My attempt at the Lights Out game.

TO RUN:
1. Download the Source Code Zip
2. Open the LightsOut_Game.sln in Visual Studio.
3. Run application in IIS Express.
4. Play the game!

Additional info:
Uses .Net core 2.1

**UPDATED
Now uses a WebAPI controller to handle game logic and JQuery to consume it.
